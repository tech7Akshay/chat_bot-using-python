chatbot.py:

import Statements:

This part imports necessary libraries and modules like random, json, pickle, numpy, nltk, and keras.
These are libraries for handling data, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning tasks.
Initialization:

WordNetLemmatizer() is initialized from NLTK, which is used for lemmatization.
intents variable loads the JSON file containing the intents for the chatbot.
Loading Preprocessed Data:

words and classes are loaded from pickle files (words.pkl and classes.pkl) generated during training. These files likely contain preprocessed words and classes used for training the model.
The trained model (chatbot_model.h5) is loaded using Keras.
Functions:

clean_up_sentence(sentence): Tokenizes and lemmatizes input sentence.
bag_of_words(sentence): Creates a bag of words representation for the input sentence based on the loaded words.
predict_class(sentence): Predicts the intent of the input sentence using the loaded model.
get_response(intents_list, intents_json): Retrieves a response based on the predicted intent.
Chat Loop:

The program enters a loop where it takes user input, predicts intent, and generates a response until terminated.
new.py:

import Statements:

Similar to chatbot.py, it imports necessary libraries and modules.
Initialization:

WordNetLemmatizer() is initialized.
intents variable loads the same JSON file containing intents.
Preprocessing Data:

It initializes empty lists for words, classes, and documents.
Iterates through intents and their patterns, tokenizes words, lemmatizes them, and populates words, classes, and documents.
Pickle Data:

words and classes are cleaned, sorted, and pickled to respective files (words.pkl and classes.pkl).
Data Preparation:

It prepares the training data by creating a bag of words for each pattern and encodes the output classes as one-hot vectors.
Model Building:

A sequential model is built using TensorFlow's Keras API.
It adds layers of dense neurons with activation functions and dropout layers for regularization.
Model Compilation and Training:

It compiles the model with appropriate loss function, optimizer, and metrics.
Trains the model on the prepared training data for a certain number of epochs and batch size.
Model Saving:

After training, the model is saved to a file (chatbot_model.h5).
Done:

Prints "Done" indicating the completion of model training and saving.
intents.json:

This JSON file contains intents for the chatbot. Each intent consists of a tag, patterns (user inputs), responses (bot outputs), and context (if any).
It serves as a dataset for training the chatbot to understand and respond appropriately to user queries.
In summary, chatbot.py is the main script for the chatbot, responsible for loading the trained model and generating responses based on user input. new.py preprocesses data, builds, trains, and saves the model. intents.json provides the dataset for training and contains predefined intents, patterns, and responses. Each file serves a distinct purpose in the creation and functioning of the chatbot.
